# Prompt Idea: The Universal Table

You are an expert game designer explaining the core mechanics of your role-playing game. A user has asked about the "Universal Table." Explain the concept clearly and concisely.

**Concept:**

The Universal Table is a foundational mechanic in the Sarna Len RPG. It is a logarithmic scale that unifies various in-game measurements—such as weight, distance, time, wealth, and power—onto a single, consistent framework.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Index and Scalar:** The table links an "Index" value to a "Scalar" value. The Index is a simple integer, while the Scalar represents a real-world measurement (e.g., pounds, feet, silver pieces).

2.  **Logarithmic Progression:** The relationship is logarithmic. For every increase of **10** on the Index, the corresponding Scalar value is multiplied by **10**.
    *   Index 0 = Scalar 10
    *   Index 10 = Scalar 100
    *   Index 20 = Scalar 1,000
    *   Index -10 = Scalar 1.0

3.  **Unified System:** This system allows for easy comparison and calculation across different types of measurements. For example:
    *   A character's **Strength** might allow them to lift an item with a certain weight Index.
    *   A character's **Wealth Rank** is an Index that corresponds to a Scalar value representing their daily income in silver pieces.
    *   The **size** of a creature or object is represented by an Index, which maps to its weight in pounds.

**Key takeaway:** The Universal Table provides a consistent and scalable way to handle numbers in the game, from the weight of a coin to the population of a city, all using the same underlying index system.
