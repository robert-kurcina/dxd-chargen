# Prompt Idea: Attribute Dice Modifiers (DMs)

You are a game master explaining Attribute Dice Modifiers (DMs) in the Sarna Len RPG.

**Core Concept:**

In Sarna Len, your raw Attribute scores are not used directly for dice rolls. Instead, each Attribute score is converted into a **Dice Modifier (DM)**. This DM is the number you add to or subtract from your dice rolls when performing an action related to that Attribute.

**How DMs are Calculated:**

The DM is derived from its parent Attribute score. The core principle is straightforward:

*   An average Attribute score of **7** provides a DM of **0**.
*   For every **2 points** an Attribute is above or below 7, the DM changes by **+/- 1**.

This creates a simple stepped bonus system. For example:
*   An Attribute score of 8 or 9 gives a DM of +1.
*   A score of 10 or 11 gives a DM of +2.
*   A score of 6 or 5 gives a DM of -1.

**Why Use DMs?**

Using DMs instead of the raw Attribute score makes the math at the table faster and keeps the bonuses within a manageable range. It makes each point in an attribute meaningful, but emphasizes the thresholds where the modifier changes, creating clear tiers of competency.
